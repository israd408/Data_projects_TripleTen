# Overview

To analyze the datasets of the businessâ€™ performance of restaurants and customers registered in the service. Zomato is a multifunctional restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. With this dataset I performed an analysis of what restaurants are popular, which generate the highest revenue, and what variables define popularity.   
With these findings I can recommend stakeholders to not focus solely on increasing their ratings as that does not directly yield the highest sales. Rather consider marketing, visibility, and accessibility to drive the success of the product. 

# Questions to Answer

1. What restaurants are popular?  
2. What restaurants generate the highest revenue? Why?  
3. What state/ city has the highest revenue?  
4. Do ratings show correlations with success of the restaurant?

# Hypothesis

Restaurants that implement a dynamic pricing strategy, adjusting menu prices based on peak hours and customer demand as predicted by historical revenue data, will demonstrate a higher profit margin compared to restaurants with static pricing models.

# Visualizations

Line chart, to look at restaurant revenue trends over a period of time   
Maps/ heat map, to show locations with most popular restaurants

# Working with the Data

* Read through all the data  
* Clean up data  
  * Empty lines  
  * Duplicates  
  * Formats   
* Look through the columns and compare them against each other. Adding them to different graphs to understand the data.   
  * Specifically compare:   
  * City x Sales amount  
  * Rating x sales QTY  
  * Sales amount x Id  
  * Rating x Id

What else am I looking for? 

* Identify top-performing restaurants based on revenue and number of orders  
* Explore trends by time (daily, weekly, monthly), and potentially by region or restaurant type
