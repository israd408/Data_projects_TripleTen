🗽 **NYC Airbnb Market Analysis**

📌 **Project Description**  
This project analyzes the Manhattan vacation rental market to help clients identify the most profitable property types and neighborhoods to invest in. The analysis is based on NYC Airbnb data and focuses on answering:

\- Which neighborhoods and property sizes (number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?  
\- How much revenue do these listings generate?

By using Excel and Pivot Tables, I explored rental data to determine investment opportunities and provide clear, data-driven recommendations.

✨ **Key Findings**  
\- Most Attractive Options:  
  \- 1-bedroom listings in the top 10 neighborhoods  
  \- Studios in Midtown Manhattan  
\- Revenue Range: $160 – $29,940 per listing  
\- Popularity Proxy: Frequency of reviews was used as a measure of demand and booking activity.

📊 **Tools & Techniques**  
\- Microsoft Excel  
\- Pivot Tables for data aggregation and insights
